  <ul>
  <li>The first time I called Oscar, it was just to paint a few spots in my house. But he was so friendly and efficient, that I later called him back to do all sorts of things, from getting my creaky gate back into top condition, to repairing and painting my front landing. Oscar is a really versatile handyman, and I always call him when I need any help around the house.<BR><BR>

  Most recently, I asked him to add a doggy door to my house. Not only did most contractors not want to deal with it, but they all quoted me at least double Oscar's price.
